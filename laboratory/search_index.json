The EHI encompasses projects with diverse study designs and goals around standardised and open access sample collection and preservation, data generation and data management criteria. One of the main objectives of the EHI is to standardise optimal sampling, preservation, and laboratory methods based on open resources and knowledge. Currently, comparability and reproducibility of research data is one of the main issues of microbiome analyses, as molecular analysis of microbial communities is particularly sensitive to cross-contamination and variation in sample collection, preservation, and data generation (Aizpurua et al. 2023). Here we detail cost-effective procedures that can be reproduced, automated and deployed in different laboratories, which are used to generate high-quality hologenomic data in the EHI. "],["overview-of-the-workflow.html", "Chapter 2 Overview of the workflow 2.1 Workflow steps 2.2 General considerations", " Chapter 2 Overview of the workflow 2.1 Workflow steps The laboratory workflow of the Earth Hologenome Initiative (EHI) is composed of six steps. Sample homogenisation and digestion: to break down the complex matrix of the sample. DNA extraction: to isolate DNA molecules from the rest of organic materials in the mixture. DNA shearing: to achieve desired molecule sizes for optimal short-read sequencing. Sequencing library preparation: to convert fragmented DNA molecules into a format that is compatible with the sequencing platform. Sequencing library indexing: to amplify the library using primers containing unique identifiers. Sequencing pool generation: to create a single sequencing pool containing multiple libraries in desired proportions. 2.2 General considerations Automatisation All the procedures implemented in the EHI laboratory workflow are automatisable in liquid handlers. Physical separation of laboratory environment The steps 1-4 should be ran in a pre-PCR laboratory environment, where loads of environmental DNA are kept as low as possible to minimise sample contamination risk. As step 5 involves PCR amplification, any downstream procedure should be run in a post-PCR laboratory environment. "],["sample-digestion.html", "Chapter 3 Sample homogeneisation and digestion 3.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 3.2 Protocol", " Chapter 3 Sample homogeneisation and digestion Homogenisation and digestion of biological samples like faeces or intestinal contents are crucial steps in the process of DNA extraction. These steps help break down the complex matrix of the sample, thus separating different compounds and molecules from each other. Faeces, for example, are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of materials, including undigested food, microbial cells, host cells, and waste products. This complex matrix can make it challenging to access and extract DNA. Homogenisation involves breaking down the solid and semi-solid components of the sample, creating a more uniform mixture that is easier to work with, while digestion also entails degrading cellular structures to release intracellular compounds to the matrix. The EHI samples are stored in a buffer that serves a dual purpose as both a preservative and a digestion buffer. The buffer facilitates the release of nucleic acids from cells and tissues through breaking down cellular membranes and structures. The EHI protocol also includes bead-beating using a combination of ceramic, silica and glass beads for sample homogenisation. The mechanical force generated by the beads’ movement and collision with the sample causes physical disruption, breaking apart cells and releasing their contents into the surrounding solution. Optimisation of bead-beating conditions is necessary to balance efficient disruption with minimal degradation, as depending on the sample, bead types, and shearing time, there is a potential risk of shearing or damaging sensitive biomolecules. 3.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 3.1.1 Instruments TissueLyser Thermoshaker 3.1.2 Plasticware Item Brand Catalogue number Lysing Matrix E 96-Well Plate MP Biomedicals 116984001-CF LX1000 SBS rack LVL ????? 3.1.3 Reagents Reagent Brand Catalogue number Storage Proteinase K 20 mg/ml Sigma-Aldrich ???? -20ºC 3.2 Protocol 3.2.1 Faeces and swabs Thaw the samples and ensure samples have entirely thawed.

The DNA extraction procedure employed in the EHI involves DNA isolation using silica magnetic beads combined with solid-phase reversible immobilisation (SPRI) to remove as many inhibitors as possible. This technique takes advantage of the binding properties of silica magnetic beads to selectively capture DNA fragments, followed by the principle of SPRI to efficiently remove impurities and elute the purified DNA. 4.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 4.1.1 Instruments Thermo Mixer Vortex Magnetic rack Fluorometer (e.g. Qubit) 4.1.2 Plasticware Item Brand Catalogue number 96-well V-shaped 1ml microplate 4titude 4ti-0125 200 µl SBS rack LVL ?????

"],["dna-shearing.html", "Chapter 5 DNA shearing 5.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 5.2 Protocol", " Chapter 5 DNA shearing Subsequently, DNA extracts need to be sheared to desired molecule sizes for optimal short-read sequencing. Short-read DNA sequencing platforms, such as Illumina sequencing, require DNA fragments to be inserted into sequencing adapters. These adapters are limited in size, typically accommodating fragments within a specific length range (e.g., 400 to 800 base pairs). Shearing the DNA to the desired fragment size ensures that the resulting library inserts are within the acceptable range for adapter ligation and subsequent sequencing. DNA shearing can be achieved using both physical methods, such as ultrasonication, and enzymatic digestion. Ultrasonication involves the use of high-frequency sound waves to break DNA molecules into smaller fragments. Enzymatic digestion involves the use of enzymes, such as restriction endonucleases or other DNA-cleaving enzymes, to break DNA molecules into smaller fragments. Each method has its advantages and considerations, and the choice between them depends on factors such as the desired fragment size range, sample type, and available equipment. 5.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 5.1.1 Instruments Covaris LE220 platform 5.1.2 Plasticware Item Brand Catalogue number Covaris 96-well plate Covaris ?????

It involves the conversion of fragmented DNA molecules into a format that is compatible with the sequencing platform. The goal of library preparation is to create a collection of DNA fragments, each with sequencing adapters attached, which enables high-throughput sequencing of the DNA molecules. This process ensures that the genetic information contained in the DNA sample can be accurately and efficiently read by the sequencing instrument. Most samples in the EHI are processed for shotgun metagenomics, which involves sequencing the genetic material of a complex mixture of organisms (e.g. host animal, bacteria, fungi, dietary remains). Adaptor-ligation based preparation is a common approach for creating sequencing libraries in shotgun metagenomics. Sequencing adapters are short DNA molecules with specific sequences that are compatible with the sequencing platform. The fragmented DNA and sequencing adapters are mixed together, and DNA ligase enzyme is used to covalently join the adapters to the ends of the DNA fragments. This creates DNA molecules with adapters on both ends. 6.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 6.1.1 Instruments Thermal cycler 6.1.2 Plasticware Item Brand Catalogue number 6.1.3 Stock reagents Reagent Brand Catalogue number Storage Molecular grade water Bionordika BN-51100 RT 6.2 Preparation of working reagents 6.2.1 Reaction enhancer Combine the following reagents and mix them thoroughly Reagent Stock concentration Mix concentration Volume per reaction PEG 4000 50% 50% (w/v) 25% (w/v) 500 µl BSA 20 mg/ml 2 mg/ml 100 µl NaCl 5M 400 mM 80 µl ddH2O 320 µl Total 1000 µl 6.3 Protocol 1.

Library QC qPCR The efficiency of library preparation can vary significantly, especially when working with a diverse range of biological samples. This variation arises due to the presence of inhibitors, which differ greatly across taxa and sample types, and can substantially reduce the enzymatic efficiency of the reactions. Measuring the concentration or molarity of the library product proves ineffective, as it encompasses measurements of target DNA with attached adaptors, DNA lacking attached adaptors, loose adaptors, and adaptor dimers. Consequently, this approach fails to provide any meaningful information about the library’s effectiveness. The most effective approach to evaluate library preparation quality involves conducting a qPCR assay utilizing PCR primers that hybridize with the adaptors linked to the DNA molecules during the library preparation step. Within the qPCR assay, only DNA molecules with adaptors attached to both ends and adaptor dimers undergo amplification. Unlike traditional PCR, qPCR offers a real-time overview of the amplification pattern, which proves invaluable for assessing the ideal library quantity, identifying inhibitor presence, and estimating the optimal number of PCR cycles required for the subsequent indexing PCR step in the pipeline. Although the amplification pattern itself cannot distinguish between library amplification and adaptor-dimer amplification, the dissociation curve provided by qPCR platforms, along with the analysis of qPCR product via agarose gel electrophoresis, greatly assists in further evaluating library quality.

"],["library-indexing.html", "Chapter 7 Library indexing 7.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 7.2 Protocol", " Chapter 7 Library indexing The second step of the adaptor-based library preparation is to amplify the library using primers containing unique identifiers. This step serves the double function of increasing the molarity of the library to high-enough levels for sequencing, and to assign a sample-specific molecular tag to each library. As library preparation efficiency can be very variable when working with a diverge range of samples derived from different taxa, in the EHI pipeline we implement a qPCR screening that inform us about the optimal number of PCR cycles the libraries should be subject to for optimal library preparation. It is crucial to carefully adjust the number of indexing PCR cycles to prevent the over-amplification of libraries, which can lead to the generation of highly clonal libraries. With each PCR cycle, an identical copy of an existing DNA sequence is produced. When libraries are excessively amplified, the resultant library could be predominantly composed of technical PCR duplicates rather than the original DNA sequence templates. Failure to appropriately calibrate this step might lead to sequencing only a fraction of the original sample’s complexity. This outcome could artificially distort the diversity of DNA molecules, potentially resulting in erroneous data interpretations. 7.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 7.1.1 Instruments Thermal cycler 7.1.2 Plasticware Item Brand Catalogue number 7.1.3 Stock reagents Reagent Brand Catalogue number Storage Molecular grade water Bionordika BN-51100 RT 7.2 Protocol 1.

Transfer the required volume of original or diluted indexed library to the library pool tube (usually 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube). 2. Final magnetic bead-based purification Once all indexed libraries have been pooled into a single pool, it is convenient to perform one last bead-purification, to 1) get rid of short fragment remains that will likely create sequencing problems, while 2) concentrating the final library pool into a lower volume.
