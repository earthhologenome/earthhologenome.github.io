Sample homogenisation and digestion: to break down the complex matrix of the sample. DNA extraction: to isolate DNA molecules from the rest of organic materials in the mixture. DNA shearing: to achieve desired molecule sizes for optimal short-read sequencing. Sequencing library preparation: to convert fragmented DNA molecules into a format that is compatible with the sequencing platform. Sequencing library indexing: to amplify the library using primers containing unique identifiers. Sequencing pool generation: to create a single sequencing pool containing multiple libraries in desired proportions. 2.2 General considerations Automatisation All the procedures implemented in the EHI laboratory workflow are automatisable in liquid handlers. Physical separation of laboratory environment The steps 1-4 should be ran in a pre-PCR laboratory environment, where loads of environmental DNA are kept as low as possible to minimise sample contamination risk. As step 5 involves PCR amplification, any downstream procedure should be run in a post-PCR laboratory environment. "],["sample-digestion.html", "Chapter 3 Sample homogeneisation and digestion 3.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 3.2 Protocol", " Chapter 3 Sample homogeneisation and digestion Homogenisation and digestion of biological samples like faeces or intestinal contents are crucial steps in the process of DNA extraction. These steps help break down the complex matrix of the sample, thus separating different compounds and molecules from each other. Faeces, for example, are composed of a heterogeneous mixture of materials, including undigested food, microbial cells, host cells, and waste products. This complex matrix can make it challenging to access and extract DNA. Homogenisation involves breaking down the solid and semi-solid components of the sample, creating a more uniform mixture that is easier to work with, while digestion also entails degrading cellular structures to release intracellular compounds to the matrix. The EHI samples are stored in a buffer that serves a dual purpose as both a preservative and a digestion buffer. The buffer facilitates the release of nucleic acids from cells and tissues through breaking down cellular membranes and structures. The EHI protocol also includes bead-beating using a combination of ceramic, silica and glass beads for sample homogenisation. The mechanical force generated by the beads’ movement and collision with the sample causes physical disruption, breaking apart cells and releasing their contents into the surrounding solution. Optimisation of bead-beating conditions is necessary to balance efficient disruption with minimal degradation, as depending on the sample, bead types, and shearing time, there is a potential risk of shearing or damaging sensitive biomolecules. 3.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents Contents. 3.2 Protocol Contents. "],["dna-extraction.html", "Chapter 4 DNA extraction 4.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 4.2 Preparation of working reagents 4.3 Protocol", " Chapter 4 DNA extraction DNA extraction involves isolating DNA molecules from the rest of organic materials in the mixture, as well as removing inhibitors such as polysaccharides, proteins and bile salts, which can affect downstream enzymatic reactions, such as adaptor ligation or PCR amplification. The DNA extraction procedure employed in the EHI involves DNA isolation using silica magnetic beads combined with solid-phase reversible immobilisation (SPRI) to remove as many inhibitors as possible. This technique takes advantage of the binding properties of silica magnetic beads to selectively capture DNA fragments, followed by the principle of SPRI to efficiently remove impurities and elute the purified DNA. 4.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 4.1.1 Instruments Thermo Mixer Vortex Magnetic rack Fluorometer (e.g. Qubit) 4.1.2 Plasticware Item Brand Catalogue number 96-well V-shaped 1ml microplate 4titude 4ti-0125 200 µl SBS rack LVL ?????

"],["dna-shearing.html", "Chapter 5 DNA shearing 5.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 5.2 Protocol", " Chapter 5 DNA shearing Subsequently, DNA extracts need to be sheared to desired molecule sizes for optimal short-read sequencing. Short-read DNA sequencing platforms, such as Illumina sequencing, require DNA fragments to be inserted into sequencing adapters. These adapters are limited in size, typically accommodating fragments within a specific length range (e.g., 400 to 800 base pairs). Shearing the DNA to the desired fragment size ensures that the resulting library inserts are within the acceptable range for adapter ligation and subsequent sequencing. DNA shearing can be achieved using both physical methods, such as ultrasonication, and enzymatic digestion. Ultrasonication involves the use of high-frequency sound waves to break DNA molecules into smaller fragments. Enzymatic digestion involves the use of enzymes, such as restriction endonucleases or other DNA-cleaving enzymes, to break DNA molecules into smaller fragments. Each method has its advantages and considerations, and the choice between them depends on factors such as the desired fragment size range, sample type, and available equipment. 5.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents Contents. 5.2 Protocol Contents. "],["library-preparation.html", "Chapter 6 Library preparation 6.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 6.2 Protocol", " Chapter 6 Library preparation Sequencing library preparation is a crucial step in the process of DNA sequencing. It involves the conversion of fragmented DNA molecules into a format that is compatible with the sequencing platform. The goal of library preparation is to create a collection of DNA fragments, each with sequencing adapters attached, which enables high-throughput sequencing of the DNA molecules. This process ensures that the genetic information contained in the DNA sample can be accurately and efficiently read by the sequencing instrument. Most samples in the EHI are processed for shotgun metagenomics, which involves sequencing the genetic material of a complex mixture of organisms (e.g. host animal, bacteria, fungi, dietary remains). Adaptor-ligation based preparation is a common approach for creating sequencing libraries in shotgun metagenomics. Sequencing adapters are short DNA molecules with specific sequences that are compatible with the sequencing platform. The fragmented DNA and sequencing adapters are mixed together, and DNA ligase enzyme is used to covalently join the adapters to the ends of the DNA fragments. This creates DNA molecules with adapters on both ends. 6.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents Contents. 6.2 Protocol Contents. "],["library-indexing.html", "Chapter 7 Library indexing 7.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents 7.2 Protocol", " Chapter 7 Library indexing The second step of the adaptor-based library preparation is to amplify the library using primers containing unique identifiers. This step serves the double function of increasing the molarity of the library to high-enough levels for sequencing, and to assign a sample-specific molecular tag to each library. As library preparation efficiency can be very variable when working with a diverge range of samples derived from different taxa, in the EHI pipeline we implement a qPCR screening that inform us about the optimal number of PCR cycles the libraries should be subject to for optimal library preparation. 7.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents Contents. 7.2 Protocol Contents.

This technique enables measuring the concentration and molarity of desired fragments (usually between 300 and 800 bp) and undesired molecules such as adaptor dimers and primer remains (usually between 30 and 150 bp). Using this information, one can calculate how much volume from each library will be needed to generate a desired amount of data. 8.1 Instruments, plasticware and reagents Contents. 8.2 Protocol Contents.
